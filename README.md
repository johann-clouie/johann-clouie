<h1 align="center">👋 Hi, I'm Johann Clouie</h1>
<h3 align="center">Senior Full-Stack Web Developer | SaaS Architect</h3>

Most startups fail because their tech can't keep up with their growth. I make sure yours does.
I help SaaS founders turn complex ideas into production-ready platforms that don't just work—they scale. With an accelerated degree in Computer Science and 4+ years of "in-the-trenches" experience with rapid-growth startups, I bridge the gap between business goals and technical execution.

### ❄️ What I bring to your team:

✔️ Zero to One: Architecting MVPs that are ready for Series A/B scaling.

✔️ Performance-First: Reducing latency and optimizing Core Web Vitals to improve user retention.

✔️ Full-Stack Mastery: Specialized in the T3 Stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Prisma) and AWS.
